# UnitTesting (C#)

The project goals are simple: We would like for you to open up the
Zen.Hr.UnitTesting.sln in Visual Studio 2013 and complete the 2 unit
tests in the Zen.Hr.Logic.Tests project.  If you don't have Visual 
Studio, you can download the Community Edition which can be found in
www.visualstudio.com.

You are free to use whatever libraries, packages, open-source tools,
or other developer productivity aids you find helpful. If you use
any, please let us know, because we're always looking for ways for
us to improve our own productivity, too.

# Our goals

We have a few things we are looking for as part of this evaluation:

1. We are interested in things like code clarity, consistency and
general code stewardship. We should be able to read the code and 
figure out what's going on, but we don't want you to drown us in 
comments, either.

2. Unit tests are important to us.  Any developer entering our 
organization must be able to understand how to build unit tests and 
have a good understanding on why they are important.
